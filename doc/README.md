# project-2-

the project: 
This project created 2 map visualizations. One map visualization shows the median college ranking of each state in the U.S. and the second map visualization shows the median undergraduate student population of colleges by state. 

the organization of the file: 
To produce the visualizations, the data set csv file must be downloaded which is in the data sub-folder. The code used to produce the visualizations is found in the project-2- folder in the Project 2.Rmd file.

how to run the file:  
The function and loop that calculates the median college rankings and the median student populations will run when the chunk runs. To use the conditional, type "R" or "P" in the console to select for the median ranking plot or median population plot. "R" is the ranking plot and "P" is the population plot. The selected plot will run when you click enter in the console.
